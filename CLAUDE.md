# CLAUDE.md

This is the entry point for AI agents working in this repository. Read this file first, then load only the skill file relevant to your current task.

## Quick Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Dev server at localhost:3000
npm run build     # Production build
npm run start     # Start production server (run build first)
npm run lint      # ESLint check
npm run format    # Format with Prettier
```

## Tech Stack (at a glance)

- **Next.js 16** App Router · React 19 · TypeScript 5
- **Tailwind CSS v4** + SCSS modules (hybrid styling)
- **Redux Toolkit** + redux-persist
- **next-themes** · Formik + Yup · Axios
- **TanStack Query** — server state / data fetching. Client `QueryProvider` (`app/_shared/components/providers/QueryProvider.tsx`) wraps the app in `app/layout.tsx`. Use `useQuery`/`useMutation` (with Axios) in client components.

All shared code lives under `app/_shared/`. Use `@/app/_shared/` for all imports from shared folders.

## Critical Rules (always apply, regardless of task)

1. **Routes** — Never hardcode route strings. Always use `ROUTES.*` from `app/_shared/lib/config/routes.ts`.
2. **Assets** — Never reference asset paths directly as strings. All assets (images, icons, fonts) live in `app/_shared/assets/` and must be exported from their `index.ts` before use. The `public/` folder is only for static files served at the root (e.g. `favicon.ico`).
3. **Images** — Always use `<Image />` from `next/image`. Never use `<img>`.
4. **Component size** — Files must not exceed 300–350 lines. Split into sub-components or hooks.
5. **Naming** — All component folders and files use **camelCase** (e.g. `fileUpload/fileUpload.tsx`).
6. **Imports** — Always use `@/app/_shared/` prefix for shared code. Never use relative `../../` paths.
7. **Modals & Dialogs** — Always create a dedicated, separate component file for every modal or dialog (e.g. `confirmDeleteModal/confirmDeleteModal.tsx`). Never inline modal or dialog content inside a parent component.
8. **Error boundaries** — `app/error.tsx` (segment) and `app/global-error.tsx` (root layout) render the shared `ErrorFallback`. Add a nested `error.tsx` to scope recovery; catch event-handler/async errors locally and surface via toast (boundaries don't catch those).
